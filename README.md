# Beach Simulator in OpenGL

*Join Anthony Tran and Joseph Bell on their adventure to frantically piece together an entire graphics application in the final two weeks of their winter quarter. Godspeed.*

### Description
Often students and faculty here at UCSD yearn for a day at the beach, but unfortunately have their desires struck down by the insurmountable quantity of obligations endowed upon them through affiliation with this educational facility. 

To remedy this, our goal is to create an explorative and reflective game experience, where the user will be able to traverse a procedurally-generated beachfront and enjoy the coming and going of the ocean waves in order to escape the overwhelming burden of academia. With this paradigm shifting graphics application, the lovely folk here at UCSD can experience the beach without all the hassle of a ten minute drive to the coast.

### Features
- First Person Camera Controls with Player Movements (no clip)
- Particle Effects
- Procedurally Generated Terrain (Diamond-square algorithm for height noise)
- Water Effects with "Realistic Waves" (Gerstner Waves)
